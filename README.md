## Notes

### XTerm Events

* *onBinary*: Adds an event listener for when a binary event fires. This is used to enable non UTF-8 conformant binary messages to be sent to the backend. Currently this is only used for a certain type of mouse reports that happen to be not UTF-8 compatible. The event value is a JS string, pass it to the underlying pty as binary data, e.g.. `pty.write(Buffer.from(data, 'binary'))`.
* *onCursorMove*: Adds an event listener for the cursor moves.
* *onData*: Adds an event listener for when a data event fires. This happens for example when the user types or pastes into the terminal. The event value is whatever `string` results, in a typical setup, this should be passed on to the backing pty.
* *onKey*: Adds an event listener for when a key is pressed. The event value contains the string that will be sent in the data event as well as the DOM event that triggered it.
* *onLineFeed*: Adds an event listener for when a line feed is added.
* *onRender*: Adds an event listener for when rows are rendered. The event value contains the start row and end rows of the rendered area (ranges from `0` to `Terminal.rows - 1`).
* *onResize*: Adds an event listener for when the terminal is resized. The event value contains the new size.
* *onScroll*: Adds an event listener for when a scroll occurs. The event value is the new position of the viewport.
* *onSelectionChange*: Adds an event listener for when a selection change occurs.
* *onTitleChange*: Adds an event listener for when an OSC 0 or OSC 2 title change occurs. The event value is the new title.
